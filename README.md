This repository is for documenting the base version of a YouTube clone project.

This specific repository is the documentation of a guided project from SuperSimpleDev. The next few iterations (ver1, ver2, etc) will be fully original, and because of that, both the code and the files posted here will have significantly more comments and just general context.
